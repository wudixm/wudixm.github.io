Base64 解码的时候，要4 个字符长度的倍数才可以正常解码，否则要添加= 或者==

```
words = base64.b64decode('MTI=')
words
'12'
words = base64.b64decode('MQ==')
words
'1'

```

This last property of python's base64 decoding ensures that the following code adding 3 padding `=` will never succumb to the TypeError and will always produce the same result.

```
>>> base64.b64decode(code + "===") == data
True
```

It's clumsy but effective method to deal with strings from different implementations of base64 encoders
