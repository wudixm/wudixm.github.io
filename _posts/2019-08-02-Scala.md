### 匿名函数

```scala
scala> var d = ()=> {var a = System.nanoTime();println(a);a}
d: () => Long = $$Lambda$791/1373646877@47d7bfb3

scala> d
res0: () => Long = $$Lambda$791/1373646877@47d7bfb3

scala> var a = d()
83504850879454
a: Long = 83504850879454
```

### 静态方法 / 单例方法

- class C defines a class, just as in Java or C++.
- object O creates a singleton object O as instance of some anonymous class; it can be used to hold static members that are not associated with instances of some class.
- object O extends T makes the object O an instance of trait T; you can then pass O anywhere, a T is expected.
- if there is a class C, then object C is the companion object of class C; note that the companion object is not automatically an instance of C.
Also see Scala documentation for object and class.

#### Usage as host of static members
**Most often, you need an object to hold methods and values/variables that shall be available without having to first instantiate an instance of some class. This is use is closely related to static members in Java.**

```scala
object A {
  def twice(i: Int): Int = 2*i
}
```
You can then call above method using A.twice(2).

**If twice were a member of some class A, then you would need to make an instance first:**

```scala
// 如果是class，必须先有对象，才能调用对象上的方法
class A() {
  def twice(i: Int): Int = 2 * i
}

val a = new A() // 其实不需要创建对象，因为这个方法的类没有instance-specific data（类独特的一些属性方法）
a.twice(2)
```
**You can see how this is redundant, as twice does not require any instance-specific data.**

#### Usage as a special named instance
You can also use the object itself as some special instance of a class or trait. When you do this, your object needs to extend some trait in order to become an instance of a subclass of it.

Consider the following code:

```scala
object A extends B with C {
  ...
}
```
This declaration first declares an anonymous (inaccessible) class that extends both B and C, and instantiates a single instance of this class named A.

This means A can be passed to functions expecting objects of type B or C, or B with C.
